These are some embedded software projects that i've worked on since about 2000.
Mostly related to elevators.
There is obviously corresponding hardware on which this software ran / runs, 
    but that was not designed by me.
Some of the variable names are in Slovak (my native tongue) - apologies for that.

I had previously uploaded this code to programmersheaven.com
At some point i tried to port the elevator controller to C; the failed/incomplete attempt 
    is in the "porting to C" folder
